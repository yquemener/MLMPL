                MACHINE LEARNING MODEL PUBLIC LICENSE

Preamble

The purpose of the present license is to give machine learning developers a way
to share a model publicly in a way that guarantees their work stays open, to
the benefit of the whole community.

Its intent is to translate the logic of popular copyleft licenses into the
world of machine learning models. It is a modification of the Affero General
Public license 3.0, with adaptations to accommodate for the differences between
a machine learning model and a typical program. Please note that this license
and its author are not affiliated with the GNU project nor Free Software
Foundation.

Machine learning models and compiled programs have some similarities but what
constitutes the source  of a model is unclear. This license aims at removing
this ambiguity.

The key principle of this license is to spread the MLMPL license to models
derived from a MLMPL model but to allow non-model outputs (e.g. text, video,
images) to be licensed without constraints by the model user as long as the
model used remains published.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the Machine Learning Model Public
License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Model" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work means either the unmodified Model or a machine learning model
based on the Model.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  A "machine learning model" or "model" is a work composed of the following
elements:
  a) A set of training programs
  b) An architecture described either as a program or in a well-documented
     description format with public specifications
  c) A set of weights
  d) Optionally, a set of inference programs used to cause the model to
     produce outputs.

  A "training program" is a program used to produce or modify the weights of
the model.

  The "architecture" of a model is the description of the inner structure of
the model. It may be included in the training program but may also be described
separately.

  "Weights" are a set of numerical values that define the behavior of a model.

  "Inference programs" are programs that use the weights of the model to create
outputs that are not new machine learning models or weights.

1. Obligations

In order for a machine learning model to be compatible with the MLMPL it must
obey the following properties:

  a) Its training programs must be licensed under the GNU Affero General Public
     License version 3 or a later revision of it. If several versions of the
     program have been used to produce the included weights, all versions of the
     training program must be included in the Model.
  b) If it uses inference programs, these programs must be licensed under the
     GNU Affero General Public License version 3 or a later revision of it.
  c) The procedures and parameters used to produce the weights must be
     included. Including but not limited to: the volume of inputs used and the
     input format used.
  d) It is not necessary, to fulfill obligation c), to include the full dataset
     used to produce the weights.


2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Model, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Model.

  The outputs from running the Model is covered by this License if the output,
given its content, constitutes a covered work. If the output does not
constitute a covered work, you are granted the right to propagate it under any
license you see fit on the following conditions:

  a) Any copyright notice accompanying the propagation of the output must
     mention the Model used.
  b) Any copyright notice accompanying the propagation of the output must
     provide an opportunity to receive the version of the Model used to produce
     the output, by providing access to the corresponding Model from a network
     server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of
     facilitating copying of models.

  Instead of the exact model used for the generation of the output, it is
acceptable, with respect to the obligation described in b), to provide a later
version of the machine learning model that exhibits similar or better
performance on the objective metrics relevant to the task at hand.

  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as
provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Model as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the copy;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Model.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Models Derived From The Model

You may convey a machine learning model based on the Model, or the
modifications to produce it from the Model under the terms of section 4,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions

  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
     it, and giving a relevant date.

  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
     released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
     requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
     notices".

  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
     regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

  d) Your model obeys all the constraints listed in section 1

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger model,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Weights Separately From The Model

You may convey the weights of the Model separately from the Model under the
terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the full Model under
the terms of this License, in a machine-readable format, in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the weights in, or embodied in, a physical product
       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
       full Model fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for
       software interchange.

    b) Convey the weights in, or embodied in, a physical product
       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
       written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
       long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
       model, to give anyone who possesses the weights either (1) a
       copy of the Model corresponding to the weights in the
       product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
       medium customarily used for model interchange, for a price no
       more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
       conveying of the model, or (2) access to copy the
       Model from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the weights with a copy of the
       written offer to provide the full Model. This alternative is allowed only
       occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the weights
       with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the weights by offering access from a designated place (gratis or
       for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the full Model in the same
       way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require
       recipients to copy the full Model along with the weights. If the place
       to copy the weights is a network server, the full Model may be on a
       different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
       equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
       next to the weight saying where to find the full Model. Regardless of
       what server hosts the full Model, you remain obligated to ensure that it
       is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the weights using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
       you inform other peers where the weights and corresponding
       full Model of the work are being offered to the general public at no
       charge under subsection 6d.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Model. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified weights is in
no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey a weight work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
full Model conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified weights on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Model conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Model shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Model, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Model remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
     terms of sections 13 and 14 of this License; or

  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
     Notices displayed by works containing it; or

  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
     authors of the material; or

  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
     those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Model. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the work from
the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Model or a work on which the Model is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the corresponding model of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the corresponding model to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE MODEL "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE MODEL
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE MODEL PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

14. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE MODEL AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE MODEL (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

15. Interpretation of Sections 13 and 14.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Model, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Model in return for a fee.

                  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
